# springmvc
This is a traiditional MVC project of Spring 5. In this project,  XML configuration is used where I define Database DataSource and connection pool, define Spring MVC view resolver and setup Hibernate session factory and Hibernate transaction manager. And without the help of Maven, the Spring library files and hibernate files are installed manually. The view part is setup through jsp and the controller implements the functions of CRUD. DAO objects help to setup the relationship from entity to the database table through hibernate session factory. Since the database is MySql, the MySql script is also provided here.
